# Setup

Welcome to your Rust + Iron + React + Webpack example project on Nitrous.

## Running the server:

In the [Nitrous IDE](https://community.nitrous.io/docs/ide-overview), start this example project via "Run > Start Rust Iron React Webpack"

Now you've got a development server running and can see the output in the Nitrous terminal window. You can open up a new shell or utilize [tmux](https://community.nitrous.io/docs/tmux) to open new shells to run other commands.

## Preview the app

In the Nitrous IDE, open the "Preview" menu and click "Port 3000".
